JUNIOR FRONTEND DEVELOPER ASSIGNMENT

Objective:
The goal of this task is to evaluate your skills in creating a React application using Redux
(either the Classic Redux approach or Redux Toolkit) and TypeScript. You will be tasked
with building a user management table that displays user information fetched from a
mock API, along with implementing local filter functionality. Specifically, you will
demonstrate your ability to:

• Building a User Management Table: Develop a table that displays user
information, including name, username, email, and phone, fetched from a mock
API. The design of the table is up to you, and you are encouraged to create a
layout that is both functional and visually appealing.
• Implement Advanced Filtering: Integrate a search feature that allows users to
filter the table by name, username, email, and phone. The displayed results
should update dynamically as the user types in the search inputs for each
column.
• Manage State with Redux: Use Redux to manage the state of the application.
You can choose between the Classic Redux approach or Redux Toolkit for more
streamlined state management.
• Ensure Type Safety: Utilize TypeScript to enforce type safety throughout the
web application.

Requirements:
1. Fetch All Users:
• Use the endpoint GET /users from JSONPlaceholder to retrieve the list of all
users. Documentation: JSONPlaceholder
2. Display Users in a Table:
• Implement a table with columns: name, username, email, and phone.
3. Implement Advanced Filtering:
• Add search input fields for each column (name, username, email, phone).
• Ensure that the table dynamically filters results based on user input in these
fields, with real-time updates.
4. State Management:
• Use Redux to manage the application state, including user data and filter
states. You can choose between Classic Redux or Redux Toolkit for this task.
5. Type Safety:
• Apply TypeScript comprehensively across the entire web application to ensure
proper typing and reduce potential runtime errors. This includes all aspects of
the application’s functionality.
6. Design and Styling:
Design the table and search inputs to be user-friendly and visually appealing. The styling
is up to you, aiming for a clean and effective user interface.

Deliverables:
• Link to a Public GitHub Repository: Provide a link to a public GitHub repository
containing your code.
• Link to Published Application: Deploy your application and provide a link to the
live version (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).
• Optional: A brief explanation of your approach and any challenges you faced.
